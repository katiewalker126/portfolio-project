    <h1>Hi I am Katie Walker</h1>
    <h2>I am an aspiring front-end developer based in Sheffield, UK</h2>
    <p>
      My interest in coding started to develop within my current job role. I
      work as an Administration Manager for a software development company in
      Sheffield. I work in the operations side of the business in areas such as
      finance, recruitment, human resources, health & safety and general office
      administration.
      <br />
      <br />
      I have increasingly become more interested in the engineering and software
      development side of the business and after some research I enrolled in the
      initial SheCodes Express class. This short introduction to coding
      intrigued me and I signed up to the SheCodes Basics course, following by
      SheCodes Plus and then SheCodes Pro focussing on front-end development.
      <br />
      <br />
      The SheCodes workshops have been invaluable, and I'm excited to continue
      my coding journey.
